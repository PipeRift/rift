# Variables

A variable is a block of memory containing an struct, a class, a native type, pointers or function pointers.

## Initialization

Variables are always default-initialized unless marked as **undefined** which keeps the memory as it was before initialization (garbage memory).

  ```ruby
  struct Type
  {
      Bool alive;
      Bool running;
  }

  void main()
  {
      Type one; // Default initialized
      Type two = undefined; // Not initialized (garbage)
      Type three(true); // 'alive' set to true
      Type four(running=true); // 'running' set to true

      Type five = four; // Copy four into five
      Type six := four; // Move four into six
      Type* seven = &six; // Seven is pointer to four
  }
